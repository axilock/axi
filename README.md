## Usage

Axi automatically integrates with your Git workflow once installed. It primarily operates through the pre-push hook to scan commits for secrets before they are pushed to remote repositories.

### Pre-push Hook

The pre-push hook automatically:
1. Scans new commits for potential secrets
2. Reports findings to the configured backend
3. Blocks pushes if secrets are detected

### Configuration

Configuration can be specified in `~/.axi/config.yaml` or `~/.axi/config.yml`:

```yaml
verbose: true    # Enable verbose output
autoupdate: true # Enable auto-updates
sentry: true     # Enable error tracking
```

## Error Codes

- `1`: Secrets found in commits
- `3`: Configuration or setup errors

## Development

### Building and Installing

For development workflow:
```bash
make buildAndInstall
```

### Distribution

Create development distribution:
```bash
make dist-dev
```

Create release distribution:
```bash
make dist-release
```

List available distributions:
```bash
make dist-list
```
